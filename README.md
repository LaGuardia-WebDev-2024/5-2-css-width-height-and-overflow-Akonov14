## Directions 
### Step #1 - Resize the div <br>
This webpage describes the ocean, with an image and a few paragraphs which are inside a `<div>`.<br>
In this first step, style the `<div>` that has a class of `'info'`, so that it takes up 70% of the width and is 200px tall.
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Make it scroll <br>
Now, make it so the `<div>` cuts off the overflowing text and presents a scrollbar instead.
<br><br>
### Step #3 - Make it scroll <br>
In this last step, write a CSS rule for the `‘pic’` class that resizes the image to take up the same width as the text.
